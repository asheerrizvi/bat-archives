# BatArchives

Check out the deployed app at: https://bat-archives.netlify.app/

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Considerations

* Since responsiveness was not an explicit requirement I haven't made the UI responsive. Please let me know if that is a requirement and I can make the changes.
* I have taken some creative freedom for styling. Layout is very similar to the mockup but the styles aren't. I can do something very similar to the mockup as well.
* The change decade filters should ideally be a dropdown or a select component. But I have used a row of buttons here for simplicity.
